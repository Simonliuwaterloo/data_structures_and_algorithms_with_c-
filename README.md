# Data Structures and algorithms with c++
This is my implementation of textbook [Data Structures and algorithms with c++](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/0470383275)
This is a course about Algorithms and Data Structures, and how to implement them in C++. This course can be considered as a follow-up of ECE150 in uwaterloo, for which you can find my code [here](https://github.com/Simonliuwaterloo/ECE150Code)
